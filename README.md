**THIS IS A WIP**
**THE PLAYGROUND IS NOT LIVE**
# The Playground #
A self-organizing learning community around decentralized systems organized with
$5000 funds for 6-week long adventures.

## What is it? ##

With the information systems available today there is the possibility for new
learning systems. 

These will not look like schools and universitites. They will reflect the tools
they are built with, and be decentralized and self-organizing, with individual
autonomy as the foundational unit.

This is a community to explore this possibility. Individuals define their own
learning, the subject and structure, and connect it to others. Funds are
distributed to them over a 6 week period to enable experimentation, creation,
and novelty.

The area of focus is decentralized systems. This field is at the centrepoint of
a revolution in our digital systems and at the core of how our learning systems
will evolve. This makes it a perfect subject matter for this community.

## How does it work? ##

### 1. Propose an Adventure! ###
Anyone can submit an adventure proposal as a PR. A proposal defines explicitly
what you plan to learn, what structures and systems you will use. It also
defines _outputs_, concrete things your adventure will produce, and ties those
outputs to funding.

### 2. The community engages ###
Once you create a proposal, it's public. Others can comment on it, copy it, or
suggest changes.

There is a rotating set of community members who make the call on whether or not
to fund an Adventure. Either way the decision goes, they post feedback in the PR
for future reference.

Proposals are judged on: 

- How well defined they are
- How they engage with existing adventures and the broader community
- Their novelty and utility 

All these criteria apply holisticly, to both what is being learned and the
systems for learning it.

### 3. Iterate or Embark! ###
If you're funded, it's time to start learning! If you're not it's also time to
start learning (and then applying again with what you learned).

Each week you must fulfill the guidelines set in your proposal in order to
recieve the portion of the funds. This could be anything from writing a regular
log, to particular milestones, to checking in with a designated advisor.
