# Adventures and Adventurers
Adventures are the core of the playground. They are 6 week self-defined learning
programs funded with $5000.

This folder contains all funded adventures. Adventure proposals are Merge
Requests.

## Proposing an Adventure 
You can propose an adventure by opening an MR adding an adventure document
to this folder.

Anyone can propose an adventure. They can have any form and work towards any
goal, as long as it's within the field of decentralized systems.

If you're looking for some inspiration check out
[ideas](https://gitlab.com/fathom/playground/issues?label_name%5B%5D=idea), 
[other
proposals](https://gitlab.com/fathom/playground/issues?label_name%5B%5D=proposal),
or this folder.

------------------------------------------------

## Archetype of an adventure
There are some elements that all adventures share. It is important that
these are **well defined**. They're what others will use
to judge, connect to, and build on an adventure.

### Subject/Goal/Concept
Each adventure centers around a particular concept being learned. This could be
anything from decentralized version control to centralization vs
decentralization in social structures.

It can be defined by referencing past work or resources around the
same concept (think wiki articles), as well as existing adventures.

### Structures/Plan
Adventures start with a plan. While they don't have to follow it to a tee
(adventures can veer in unexpected but rewarding directions), it is important
that it be clearly defined.

A plan includes how an adventurer will go about their learning, what structures
they will use, and what resources they will depend on. They should describe
where an adventure intersects with other adventures, and individuals outside the
playground. 

Abstraction is useful. An adventure proposal can extend beyond itself by
defining a structure that others can replicate and build on top of.

### Artifacts
Adventures produce artifacts. These are everything an adventure creates that are
openly shared. Logs, documents, software, media, anything an adventurer
considers valuable.

An adventure proposal should describe what they will produce each week, and the
criteria around them. These should be kept simple and easy to verify.

----------------------------------------

## Funding adventures
Adventures are reviewed through the process described
[here](../governance/reviewing.md).

If an adventure is accepted, a smart-contract will be created in order to
distribute funds. This contract will allow funds to be released at a fixed
interval to the adventurer. 

## Identitifying adventures and adventurers

Adventures are focus on what is important. The identities of participants is
not. Adventurers are not obligated to identify themselves in any
particular way. However, they will need to use a Github identity and an Ethereum
identity in the process of interacting in the Playground.

It is also important to be able to identify adventures themselves. Open
proposals are identified by the number of their Merge Request. Active adventures
are identified via the address of their funding contract, which should be stored
in their file in this folder.

## The goals of this process
This is all intentionally left open-ended. Adventures should be driven by
those creating and going on them, not by the formal process around them. Instead
these rules and guidelines should support adventures, especially in their
interactions with one and another, in driving the playground forward.
