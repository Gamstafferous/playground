# The Judging Process
Selecting adventures to fund is the driving force in the playground.

## Selecting Judges

1. New judges are selected by [The Dictator](/PlIPs) for a _fixed term_
2. At the end of their terms each judge __must_ select a successor though they
   also do so before.
3. The Dictator can veto

## Terms and the Selection process
Each is assigned a fixed number of Applications to interact with. This is to
provide a definitive term.
