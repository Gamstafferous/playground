# The Review Process
Selecting adventures to fund is the driving force in the playground.

## Selecting Reviewers

1. Anyone can nominate themselves to be a reviewer by creating an issue for it. 
2. The current [Dictator](/roles.md#Dictator) selects reviewers
3. Reviewers operate on a fixed term of 12 weeks.

## Reviewers duties and the selection process
During their terms reviewers deal with adventure proposal MRs. They will be
assigned to reviewers either through self-selction or through a central process. 

Once assigned a reviewer there are 3 outcomes:
1. An application is commented on. This can be for clarification, questions, or
   suggestions
2. An application is closed, if the reviewer feels it is not a good candidate to
   fund
3. An application is escalated

For either final outcome the reviewer should provide clear reasoning. 

### Consensus and Veto
When an application is escalated, all other reviwers can examine it. They can
also comment. If they think it's a good idea they can approve it.

If a majority of reviewers approve an application then it gets merged in and is
funded.

If a majority does not, but a reviewer feels strongly about an application, they
can veto it's funding. Each reviewer has 2 vetos.


## The goals of this process
We want to select for powerful adventures, that create value for individuals and
the community. This means allowing for both consensus and risk to drive decision
making. It also means having churn in the decision makers, to allow old ones to
leave and new ones to come in, creating evolution and change.

We also want to create value as from the selection process itself. If we can
interact with all applications in a way that promotes iteration, connection, and
growth, the playground is more powerful.
