# Playground Improvement Proposals
The Playground is an on-going emergent system. As such we need to be able to
change the system while in motion.

We will start with a simple core and use a nomic mechanism in order to grow and evolve.

### Creating PlIPs
Anyone can create a proposal by creating in issue with the label `plip`. The
issue should clearly spell out what they are proposing and the motivations.

### Discussing and Working on PlIPs
If a PliP requires a change to documentation an MR should be made doing so. If
the PlIP is approved, this MR will be merged in.

All documents in this repository can be changed by PlIPs, including this one. In
this way the PlIP process can change over time.

### Passing PlIPs
PlIPS are passed by the [Dictator](/roles.md#Dictator) as defined in the roles
document.
