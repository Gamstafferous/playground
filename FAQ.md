#### What are decentralized systems?
These are systems without any central authority. Instead they enable individuals
to coordinate and come to consensus on how the system should function. 

Some examples of decentralized systems: 

- Blockchain systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum
- Git, a distributed version control system
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)
- [Secure ScuttleButt](https://ssbc.github.io/secure-scuttlebutt/)

#### Who can be a learner?
Anyone! The playground is open to people of all interests, skill-levels and
backgrounds. What's important is a drive to learn, and the ability to think
critically about your own learning and others'.

#### What can I do?
Anything! Well, almost. Your adventure has to be related to [decentralized
systems](#what-are-decentralized-systems). Other than that though it's wide
open. Adventures can be focused on individuals or involve groups, be directed
towards new fundamental research or surveys of the existing knowledge. They can
be focused on culture, arts, language, technology, biology, sociology,
economics, computer-science, or anything else you can think of.

If in doubt, try. 

#### What's in it for the funders? 
The creation of new knowledge benefits everyone. On top of this the playgroud
will generate new systems to organize learning, which will be shared openly.

#### How sustainable is the playground?
Right now, not very. The goal at this stage is to experiment, and document
thoroughly. However, there are multiple paths to sustainability...
